# ParsingWorkout

This project is a Java application created on Eclipse that demonstrates various parsing operations between strings and integers. It includes classes that showcase the conversion of strings to integers and vice versa, along with string manipulation and concatenation.

## Usage

This application serves as a simple workout for practicing parsing operations in Java. It includes examples of parsing strings to integers, converting integers to strings, and manipulating string data.

## Requirements

- Java
- Eclipse IDE

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run the classes to see the parsing operations and string manipulations in action.

## Classes

### ParsingStringtoInt

A class that demonstrates the parsing of strings to integers. It includes examples of converting string representations of numbers to their integer equivalents and showcases string manipulation operations.

### ParsingIntToString

A class that showcases the conversion of integers to strings. It demonstrates how to parse integers and manipulate them as strings, along with concatenating string data.

Feel free to explore these classes and experiment with the parsing operations and string manipulations in the Java programming language.
